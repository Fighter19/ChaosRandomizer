ChaosRandomizer
===============

ChaosRandomizer is a small tool which takes a Chao in your
Chao Garden of Sonic Adventure 2 Battle and changes it's values.
It tries to generate a feel of corruption without crashing the program.

Before using this program, be aware that this randomizes your Chaos.
This will mean your current Chaos WILL BE GONE! so make a backup of
your Chaos before using this tool.

Usage:
-------

Startup SA2B and visit the Chao Garden.
Run the program (ChaoRandom.exe)

This project is licensed under MIT (see LICENSE.md)
Reason for this is that this project is not really big or well-structured, and people should be allowed to simply copy
parts of it without worrying about anything.

However I'd like to mention that it'd be appreciated to also upload 
changes to this project, when distributing it in a binary form.
Especially in a project like this, where malicious behaviour could be easily injected without further notice.

Thanks to:
